## Features

- 7√ó7 board, move and wall mechanics faithfully implemented
- Smooth turn switching between human and AI players
- Clear state flow: selecting, placing, playing, finished
- Robust undo/redo (Zustand snapshot time travel)
- All core logic covered by unit tests
- Modern UI (Tailwind CSS v4)
- Static build, deployable to GitHub Pages or any static host

## Game Overview

- Two-player or single-player (vs AI)
- Placing phase: players alternate placing stones
- Playing phase: select a stone, move up to 2 steps, then build a wall
- Game ends when all stones are surrounded; territory is scored automatically
- Undo/redo at any time
